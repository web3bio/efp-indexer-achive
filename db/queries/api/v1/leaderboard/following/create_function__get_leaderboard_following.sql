-- Function: get_leaderboard_following
-- Description: Counts the unique addresses that each user is following in the
--              view_list_records_with_nft_manager_user_tags, groups the
--              results by user, and orders them by the number of unique
--              addresses in descending order. Includes a LIMIT parameter to
--              control the number of returned rows. The function filters by
--              version and type, excluding blocked or muted relationships.
-- Parameters:
--   - limit_count (BIGINT): The maximum number of rows to return.
-- Returns: A table with 'address' (types.eth_address) and 'following_count'
--          (BIGINT), representing each user and their count of unique
--          following addresses.
